                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p class="lead">India generates approximately 62 million tonnes of waste per year, with only 12
                    million tonnes being treated. Because of the lack of waste segregation, the percentage of waste
                    that is treated is extremely low. </p>
                <p class="lead">Waste segregation is crucial to prevent health problems that can result from
                    improperly disposed of waste and contaminants, as well as to lessen the impact that it has on
                    the environment.</p>

                <h2>Our Solution</h2>
                <p class="lead"><strong>Crap Guru</strong> attempts to solve this problem by attacking it at its
                    source. It aims to bring waste-segregation to every household via the internet, raise public
                    awareness, and increase the threshold of waste that is treated.</p>
                <p class="lead"><strong>Crap Guru</strong>, is dedicated to addressing two of the UN's Sustainable
                    Development Goals: <strong>Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production)</strong> and
                    <strong>Goal 13 (Climate Action) </strong>. Through our platform, we aim to create awareness and
                    educate the masses about the importance of responsible consumption and production, as well as
                    the urgent need for action on climate change.

                <p class="lead mb-0">Our use of <strong>Machine Learning</strong> to assist in the separation of
                    various
                    waste types is one distinctive feature of our project. We can accurately categorise and
                    segregate different forms of waste by training our algorithms on big data sets of waste samples,
                    making it simpler for people and communities to recycle and dispose of their waste responsibly.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-0">This procedure not only reduces the quantity of waste that is dumped in
                    landfills, but it also makes it simpler to recycle and reuse items, conserving resources and
                    lowering our environmental impact. <strong>Crap Guru</strong> is utilising cutting-edge
                    technology to build a more sustainable future for everyone.</p>
